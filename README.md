# 6-week-project
6 Week Data Analysis partnership in collaboration with the NHS

All of the code is split into 3 files in src/function/ by:
-Data Preprocessing
-Model Creation
-Data visualisation

These functions are all combined in the src/main.py function which is the only script that needs to be run.

In the main.py script, different lines can be (un)commented based on the needs of the user.

There is also a src/test.py script which was created at the very start of the project to play around with the data and provide initial visualisations.
